# Object Detection and Interactive Game Development
 Application of computer vision techniques in real-world scenarios, such as object detection and interactive game creation

This project focuses on applying computer vision techniques to practical scenarios, with two main components: object detection based on color and the development of an interactive game, all programmed in Python.

In the first part of the project, students are tasked with implementing a variety of image filters using basic functions, including those covered during lab sessions, and two additional filters of their choice. A key component is the creation of the "Object_Color_Detection" function, which is designed to detect objects based on their color. Building on this, students are encouraged to propose enhancements to improve the accuracy or functionality of this detection method. The color detection feature is then used to develop two creative applications: an "Invisibility Cloak," where an object becomes transparent on screen, and a "Green Screen" effect, allowing for the replacement of backgrounds.

The second part of the project focuses on developing an interactive "brick racing game." In this game, players control a car that moves left or right to avoid obstacles. The carâ€™s movement is based on the detection of a specific color through the camera, allowing the player to interact with the game using real-world objects. To enhance the game experience, students are required to implement additional features, such as a scoring system or increasing speed as the game progresses, to make gameplay more dynamic and engaging.
